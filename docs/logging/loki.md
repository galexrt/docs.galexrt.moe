***

If you can use Loki instead of Elasticsearch, just do it!

From an operational perspective Loki can be run with a lot less resources than a whole EFK (Elasticsearch Fluentd Kibana) stack.

> It just feels better not having to "spend" 3 servers to just run an Elasticsearch cluster for "some logs" which maybe "once a month" someone needs to take a look to investigate an issue with a Pod.
