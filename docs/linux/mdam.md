!!! note
    Don't forget to keep your [`mdadm.conf`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/mdadm.conf) uptodate when creating, modifiying, deleting mdadm arrays.

## Generate `mdadm.conf`

```console
mdadm --detail --scan >> /etc/mdadm.conf
```

## Grow RAID 5 to RAID 6

!!! danger
    **DON'T FORGET TO SPECIFY THE `--backup-file=FILE` for `mdadm --grow` operations!**
    Otherwise if the host is (forced) shutdowned (e.g., power failure), data can / will be lost.

(This "backup file" should be on different disk / storage, not on the mdadm array you are growing!)

## Speed-up RAID rebuild

!!! note 
    This may or may not improve your mdadm RAID rebuild performance, as it the speed depends on many factors such as disk speeds, etc.

This assumes your disks are `sda`, `sdb` and `sdc`, and the RAID array is `md0` (`/dev/md0`).

```console
for disk in sd{a..c}; do
    blockdev --setra 16384 "/dev/${disk}"
    echo 1024 > "/sys/block/${disk}/queue/read_ahead_kb"
    echo 256 > "/sys/block/${disk}/queue/nr_requests"
    # Disable NCQ on all disks.
    echo 1 > "/sys/block/${disk}/device/queue_depth"
done

# Set read-ahead to 64 MiB for /dev/md0
blockdev --setra 65536 /dev/md0

# Set stripe_cache_size to 16 MiB for /dev/md0
echo 16384 > /sys/block/md0/md/stripe_cache_size
```
